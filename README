This is a custom matcher class for rspec and a few cucumber steps to help validate

To use this, copy json_matchers.rb into your #{RAILS_ROOT}/spec, and copy json_steps.rb
into #{RAILS_ROOT}/features/step_definitions.  Then in your cucumber, you can do such

Then I should see the following JSON
 | column | column2 |
 | value  | value2  |

Then I should not see the following JSON
 | column | column2 |
 | value  | value2  |

== TODO

turn this into a gem
